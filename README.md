i'am daniel and love to learn
I started learning Python in 2021, and that was the beginning of my love for the world of programming. A lot has happened since then and I’ve learned so much. I love exploring different frameworks, various programming languages, and new topics.

On my [X page](https://x.com/DanyByte11), I post short but important and interesting topics.
